# Architecture decisions

> Assume that a single account may store hundreds of resume points
> Assume that the service must be highly scalable and fast â€“ including the data backend

I chose to store the data as one document per resume point:
```
{
	accountId: 123456789,
	videoId: 123456780,
	timePoint: 12.3
}
```
This is more like "relational database" style, but has advantage that upsert action is very easy and atomic just with updateOne MongoDb command. Performance of reading operations is not hurt, since we are using an index.
With this approach one account can contain very high number of resume points without any problems.

The `ResumePointRepository` creates the multikey index on accountId+videoId which covers all the required queries (on accountId separately or on both properties).

Using Docker Compose allows to scale the database and/or API to multiple nodes if needed.
